LanguageClassifer
=================

Download LanguageClassifier, train it with text files that you know the language/category of, then have it classify text files that you don't know the language/category of.

LanguageClassifer uses a simplified version of Bayes' Law, an algorithm used in spam detection systems.

This script can be used to classify anything. It will take text files and train the system to recognize the words that are more likely to appear in each category. It can then use that data to classify text files from unknown categories.
